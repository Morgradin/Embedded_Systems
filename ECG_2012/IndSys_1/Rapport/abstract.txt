The main task of this assignment was to develop the software for a Electro-Cardiogram (ECG) scanner using the Pan-Thompkins QRS-Detection Algorithm. By using this algorithm and writing a program in C we have created a program capable of determining a persons heartbeat from a set of data gathered from a ECG scanner. Our conclusions are that this is entirely feasible, and we recommend the implementation of this algorithm, though it is desirable to make the calculations using hardware, in order to optimize the running speed and make the calculations dynamic.
